# THIS IS A PHP MAIL SCRIPT PROJECT

# I CREATED THIS PROJECT AFTER I REALIZED OUR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH COLLECTION OF CLASS MEMBERS EMAIL ADDRESSES.

# HE WAS COLLECTING THE EMAIL ADDRESSES OF THE STUDENTS THROUGH WHATSAPP WHICH WAS TIME CONSUMING. THEREFORE, I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

# TECHNOLOGIES I USED TO BUILD THIS PROJECT: HTML, CSS, JS(little), PHP $ MYSQL.
